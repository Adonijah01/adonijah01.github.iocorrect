Hi, I'm Adonijah.  
I do cybersecurity.  

I'm a penetration tester and security enthusiast with a focus on ethical hacking, cloud security, and vulnerability assessments.  

In my free time, I play CTFs, build boot-to-root challenges, and refine my skills in exploit development and privilege escalation. I also enjoy sharing knowledge through tutoring and community engagement.  

Always learning, always hacking.
