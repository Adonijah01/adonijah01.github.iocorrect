Hi, I'm Adonijah  
I do cybersecurity.  

![Desktop View](/assets/giphy.webp){: .right }{: w="375" h="190" }

I'm a penetration tester and security enthusiast with a focus on ethical hacking, cloud security, and vulnerability assessments.  

In my free time, I play CTFs, build boot-to-root challenges, and refine my skills in exploit development and privilege escalation.  
I also enjoy sharing knowledge through tutoring and community engagement.  

Vim over Nano, by the way.  

GNU/Linux  

Always learning, always hacking.
